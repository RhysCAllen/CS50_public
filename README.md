# CS50_public

Harvard and MIT created edX in 2012 as a way to offer massively online open courses (MOOCs) free to the public. 
The CS50 series of courses at HarvardX are identical to those offered to Harvard students.

The curriculum and all course content can be viewed here: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/courses/

CS50 students are encouraged to share their final projects publicly via video and text summaries. However, because final projects are counted towards completion of a graded course, sharing the code is not allowed (https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/honesty/).
